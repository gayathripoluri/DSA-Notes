# DSA Notes & Progress Tracker

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey. This repository tracks my progress, provides problem solutions in **C++**, and contains detailed notes on various DSA topics.

## üöÄ Progress Overview

Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of my current progress across topics:

![Progress Pie Chart](images/progress_pie_chart.png)

- **Arrays**: 20% completed
- **Strings**: 15% completed
- **Dynamic Programming**: 30% completed
- **Graphs**: 25% completed
- **Trees**: 10% completed

## üìù Topic-wise Notes

These are my detailed notes on different DSA topics. I summarize key concepts and problem-solving techniques to help with quick revision:

1. [Arrays](notes/arrays.md)
2. [Strings](notes/strings.md)
3. [Dynamic Programming](notes/dynamic-programming.md)
4. [Graphs](notes/graphs.md)
5. [Trees](notes/trees.md)

## üíª Problem Solutions (C++)

This section contains my **C++ solutions** for various DSA problems. The solutions are organized by topic for easy navigation:

- **Arrays**
  - [Two Sum](solutions/arrays/two-sum.cpp)
  - [Merge Sorted Arrays](solutions/arrays/merge-sorted-arrays.cpp)
- **Strings**
  - [Longest Palindromic Substring](solutions/strings/longest-palindromic-substring.cpp)
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - [Knapsack Problem](solutions/dynamic-programming/knapsack.cpp)
- **Graphs**
  - [Depth First Search (DFS)](solutions/graphs/dfs.cpp)
- **Trees**
  - [Binary Tree Traversal](solutions/trees/binary-tree-traversal.cpp)

## üìä My Progress Tracker

I use a pie chart to visualize my progress. The chart updates as I solve more problems and master new topics.

1. **Generate the chart** using Python: 
   - Clone the repo and use `generate_progress_chart.py` to update the chart with your latest progress.
   
2. **Track your journey**: 
   - Update the `progress` array in the Python script as you complete more topics.

## üìö Resources

I keep track of useful resources like books, articles, and tutorials that help me in my learning process:

- **[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)**
- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**
- **[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)**
- **[Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/)**
